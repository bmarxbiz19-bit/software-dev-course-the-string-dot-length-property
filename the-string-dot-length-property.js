/*

Objective:
Practice using the .length property by calculating the length of
multiple predefined strings and assigning the results to specific variables.

Instructions:
You will be provided with several predefined string variables.
Your task is to:
  - Use the .length property to calculate the length of each string.
  - Assign the length of each string to its corresponding length variable.
  - Ensure that each length variable contains the correct value.

*/

// Starter Code (Pre-filled):
// Predefined strings
let stringOne = "Coding Bootcamp";
let stringTwo = "JavaScript";
let stringThree = "";

// Your task: Assign the length of each string to the corresponding variable
let lengthOne = 15;   // Length of stringOne
let lengthTwo = 10;  // Length of stringTwo
let lengthThree = undefined; // Length of stringThree

// Your code here
console.log(stringOne + " has " + sringOne.length + " characters." )
console.log(stringTwo + " has " + sringTwo.length + " characters." )
console.log(stringThree + " has " + sringThree.length + " characters." )
